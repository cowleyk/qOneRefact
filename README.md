##Corrections Based on Comments
* CSS Styling
    - in style.css, the #tagLine styling and other elements have text properties defined
    - relative measurements used in my #graphImg element to insure the graph occupied the entire parent container

* I removed *most* console.log elements, I left the ones in blocks where the console.log was the only code

* All unnecessary comments removed, only comments left are explanatory

* HTML block appended using jquery are formatted for readability with newlines and indentation

* index.html indentation is improved, no h1,h2,h3... tags used for text styling

* not sure index.html qualifies as 'Semantic HTML'.  Would love suggestions on where to improve.

* will be sure to actually use stories and document evidence of an agile workflow on the next quarter project

* flot-chart graphs are not 100% formatted, plan is to eventually switch to D3 generated graphs so I'm not putzing with them any further.
